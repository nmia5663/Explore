Game Overview:
Platform: Available on both iOS and Android devices.
Objective: Similar to the traditional Monopoly game, the goal is to become the wealthiest player by acquiring properties, building landmarks, and collecting rent from other players. However, Monopoly Go has additional elements and events to keep the gameplay dynamic.
Key Features:
Digital Board: The game is played on a digital board that can be customized with different themes and designs.
Landmarks & Properties: Players can purchase and upgrade properties, which are represented as landmarks in the game. Upgrading landmarks increases their value and the rent collected when other players land on them.

In-Game Currency: There are multiple forms of currency, such as cash, dice, and gems, which players use to buy properties, upgrade landmarks, or participate in events.
Social Features: The game allows you to play with friends or against random players online. You can also trade properties, form alliances, and engage in friendly competition.
Daily Rewards & Bonuses: Players can collect daily rewards, including free dice rolls and other in-game bonuses. There are also special codes and events that provide additional rewards.
Monetization: While the game is free-to-play, it includes in-app purchases for additional dice rolls, currency, and other premium items to enhance the gameplay experience.
